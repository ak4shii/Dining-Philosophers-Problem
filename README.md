# Dining-Philosopher-Problem

## Project Overview
The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, often used to illustrate issues of resource sharing and process coordination. The scenario involves philosophers sitting around a circular table, with a fork placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. In this problem, each philosopher alternates between two states: thinking and eating. To eat, a philosopher must acquire two forks â€” the one on their left and the one on their right. After eating enough, the philosopher places the forks back on the table, allowing others to use them, and transitions back to the thinking state.
